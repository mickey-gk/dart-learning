// getters and setters are important for data encapsulation -
//  preventing outside libraries from accessing properties of a defined class and function.


// defining a getter in dart:
//  return_type get getter_name { return content...}
//  or, return _tyope get getter_name => content...

// defining a setter in dart:
// set setter_name(parameter) => content...



// Why Is Setter Important?
// It is used to set the value of a private property.
// It is also used for data validation.
// It gives you better control over the data.


// When To Use Getter And Setter
// Use getter and setter when you want to restrict the access to the properties.
// Use getter and setter when you want to perform some action before reading or writing the properties.
// Use getter and setter when you want to validate the data before reading or writing the properties.
// Donâ€™t use getter and setter when you want to make the properties read-only or write-only.
